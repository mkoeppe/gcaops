# Graph Complex Action on Poisson Structures

Python package implementing the action of Kontsevich's graph complex(es) on Poisson structures.

## Installation

For now: download the source code and extract it to a folder; in Python (or SageMath) do:

```python3
import sys
sys.path.append(r'/path/to/gcaops')
```

where `/path/to/gcaops` is the path to the folder containing the source code.

Then you can do:

```python3
from algebra.superfunction_algebra import SuperfunctionAlgebra
from graph.undirected_graph import UndirectedGraph
from graph.undirected_graph_complex import UndirectedGraphComplex
```

etc.
